tagline: God's own country.
information: There's a hundred thousand streets in this city. And I just turn up the parts of myself that are them and turn down the parts that aren't. I'm not a good enough actor to become a character. It feels like not that long ago that I was on a show called 'Young Hercules' in which I had a fake tan and wore tight leather pants and fought imaginary monsters. It's nice to be around people that have a sense of the world around them, that are, in general, more conscious and conscientious.Anything a minute on either side of that and you're on your own. I hear about actors who become the role and I think 'I wonder what that feels like'. I fantasized about robbing banks for a long time, ever since I was a kid. My character seems to think that he is, so he would define it. I could be whatever you want.

- I'm really not good at knowing what people want, because don't have that talent.

    review: In most movies you spend so much time looking for any scraps of truth, and in this movie you're just marinating in it. I think like a girl, I think. Because I was home-schooled, I didn't have a lot of friends and I did ballet, which was always just girls. Anything happens in that five minutes, then I'm yours, no matter what. And its important to know that there are some changes you can't control and that there are others you can.

    review: It feels like not that long ago that I was on a show called 'Young Hercules' in which I had a fake tan and wore tight leather pants and fought imaginary monsters. Change moves in spirals, not circles. I think the one thing I love most about being an adult is the right to buy candy whenever and wherever I want. Anything happens a minute either side of that, and you're on your own. I could be fun, if you want.

    review: But everytime that happens, what do you get? You get a new day. Then, telling Derek Cianfrance that I'd ever I could rob a bank I'd do it on my motorcycle, and he said 'That's weird, I just wrote a script about that'. Because for me, they're all me. I want all of you, forever, everyday. You and me...everyday. I fantasized about robbing banks for a long time, ever since I was a kid.

faq:
  - question: If ever I try to predict, I'm sure I will be instantly humbled?
    answer: I went through puberty in a theme park. If I drive for you, you give me a time and a place, I give you a five minute window. We're always changing. I won't eat my cereal.
  - question: Hey girl, I brought home a few bottles of wine since I know you needed more corks for that pinterest project?
    answer: I could be whatever you want. It just felt meant to be. You have a shelf life as an actor, so you have to find another way to express yourself. I'm really not good at knowing what people want, because don't have that talent.
